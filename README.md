# Sum it up

An article summarization algorithm built for fun. 

Check it out at www.jakemor.com/sumitup. 

### Algorithm

How it works:

* Extract proper nouns from article body
* Throw away proper nouns that aren't in the title
* Order remaining proper nouns by number of appearences in article body
* Show all sentences in article body that include most occuring proper nouns

This is by no means a perfect algorithm, but it seems to work pretty well!
